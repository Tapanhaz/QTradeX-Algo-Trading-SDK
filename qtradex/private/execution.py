Execution class for interacting with a cryptocurrency exchange via the CCXT library.

Methods:
    __init__(self, exchange_id, api_key=None, api_secret=None):
        Initializes the CCXTWrapper with the provided exchange and API credentials.

    create_order(self, self.symbol, side, order_type, amount, price):
        Creates a limit order on the exchange.

    cancel_order(self, order_id, self.symbol):
        Cancels a single open order.

    cancel_orders(self, order_ids, self.symbol):
        Cancels multiple open orders.

    cancel_all_orders(self, self.symbol):
        Cancels all open orders for a given self.symbol asynchronously.

    fetch_open_order(self, order_id, self.symbol=None):
        Fetches details of a specific open order.

    fetch_open_orders(self, self.symbol=None):
        Fetches all open orders for a given self.symbol.

    fetch_ticker(self, self.symbol, params=None):
        Fetches the current price ticker for a given self.symbol.

    place_market_order_with_depth(self, self.symbol, side, amount, depth_percent):
        Places a market order at a specified depth percentage below or above the current market price.

    drip_by_time(self, self.symbol, side, total_amount, chunks, pause_seconds):
        Places repeat market orders in chunks with a pause between each order.

    drip_to_limit(self, self.symbol, side, total_amount, chunks, pause_seconds, limit_price):
        Places repeat market orders in chunks with a pause, but temporarily stops if the price is below a set limit.

    drip_to_market(self, self.symbol, side, total_amount, chunks):
        Places repeat market orders in chunks, waiting for the market to respond before proceeding with the next order.

    iceberg_order(self, self.symbol, side, total_amount, iceberg_limit):
        Monitors price and places orders to maintain the iceberg limit until the total amount is exhausted.

    top_of_book(self, self.symbol, side, total_amount):
        Places a market order at the top of the order book, continuously monitoring bid/ask prices.
