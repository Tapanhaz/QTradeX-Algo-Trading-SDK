    """
    Simulate trading using a bot with live data updates, allowing for paper trading
    without executing real trades. This function continuously fetches new data,
    updates the bot's strategy, and prints trade suggestions and balance changes.

    Notes:
     - Anytime 'wallet' is passed to client side, a copy is used, since all
       wallet copies are PaperWallets.

     - All backtests are started with 1 of _both_ currency and assets so that the bot
       will warm up unbiased

    Parameters:
    bot (object): The trading bot that contains the strategy and execution logic.
    data (object): The data object containing market data and candle information.
    wallet (object): The wallet object representing the user's balance and assets.
    tick_size (int, optional): The time interval in seconds between each trading tick.
                                Defaults to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

    Returns:
    None
